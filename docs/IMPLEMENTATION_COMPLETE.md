# ✅ Pending Transaction Feature - COMPLETE

## Implementation Summary

Successfully implemented a complete system for handling transaction requests from unauthenticated users on the upload page, with automatic claiming after authentication.

---

## 🎯 Core Requirements Met

### 1. **Upload Page (No Authentication Required)**
✅ User can visit `/upload?brand=adidas&amount=1000` without logging in
✅ Upload receipt and fill transaction details
✅ Data saved to backend with unique session ID
✅ "View all brands" dropdown included (as requested)

### 2. **Rewards Page (Authentication Required)**
✅ Same UI as upload page
✅ Requires user to be logged in
✅ Additional coin redemption feature
✅ "View all brands" dropdown included (as requested)
✅ Immediate transaction creation (no pending state)

### 3. **Automatic Claiming After Authentication**
✅ After phone verification, pending transaction is automatically claimed
✅ After regular login, pending transaction is automatically claimed
✅ Transaction assigned to authenticated user
✅ Session ID cleared from localStorage

### 4. **Data Persistence**
✅ Pending transactions stored in database (not just localStorage)
✅ Auto-expires after 24 hours
✅ Cleanup script for maintenance

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Frontend (webapp)

**Files Modified:**
- `apps/webapp/src/app/upload/page.tsx` - Upload page with proper Brand interface
- `apps/webapp/src/components/PhoneVerification.tsx` - Auto-claim after OTP
- `apps/webapp/src/app/login/page.tsx` - Auto-claim after login
- `apps/webapp/src/lib/api.ts` - New API functions

**Key Changes:**
- Changed from custom `Brand` type to API `Brand` interface
- Uses `selectedBrand` (nullable) instead of `selected`
- Proper UUID validation
- Session ID generation and storage
- "View all brands" dropdown on BOTH pages

### Backend (API)

**Files Created:**
- `apps/api/src/coins/entities/pending-transaction.entity.ts` - Entity with proper column mapping
- `apps/api/src/coins/services/pending-transaction.service.ts` - Business logic
- `apps/api/src/coins/controllers/pending-transaction.controller.ts` - API endpoints
- `apps/api/src/coins/dto/create-pending-transaction.dto.ts` - DTOs
- `apps/api/src/coins/dto/pending-transaction-response.dto.ts` - Response DTO
- `apps/api/src/migrations/1759877635657-CreatePendingTransactionsTable.ts` - Database migration
- `apps/api/src/scripts/cleanup-pending-transactions.ts` - Maintenance script

**Files Modified:**
- `apps/api/src/coins/coins.module.ts` - Added new entity, service, controller

**Key Implementation Details:**
- Entity properly maps camelCase to snake_case column names
- Indexes on session_id, claimed_by, expires_at for performance
- Brand validation before creating pending transaction
- Updates existing pending transaction if session ID already exists
- Auto-expiration after 24 hours

## 🔧 Technical Solution to Column Naming Issue

**Problem**: TypeORM was looking for `createdAt` but database had `created_at`

**Solution**: Explicitly mapped all columns with `name` property:
```typescript
@Column({ type: 'varchar', length: 100, name: 'session_id' })
sessionId!: string
```

**Result**: ✅ Entity now correctly maps camelCase TypeScript to snake_case PostgreSQL

---

## 📊 Database Schema

**Table**: `pending_transactions`

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| id | uuid | Primary key |
| session_id | varchar(100) | Unique session identifier |
| brand_id | uuid | Reference to brand |
| bill_amount | int | Transaction amount |
| receipt_url | varchar(500) | S3 URL of receipt |
| file_name | varchar(255) | Original filename |
| expires_at | timestamptz | Expiration time (24h) |
| claimed | boolean | Whether claimed |
| claimed_by | uuid | User who claimed |
| claimed_at | timestamptz | When claimed |
| created_at | timestamptz | Creation time |
| updated_at | timestamptz | Last update time |

**Indexes**:
- `idx_pending_tx_session_id` on session_id
- `idx_pending_tx_claimed_by` on claimed_by
- `idx_pending_tx_expires_at` on expires_at

## 🔄 Complete User Flow

### Scenario: Unauthenticated User → Upload → Sign In

1. **User lands on**: `http://localhost:3002/upload?brand=adidas&amount=1000`
2. **Page loads**: Brands fetch from API (no auth needed)
3. **User selects brand**: From carousel or "View all brands" dropdown
4. **User uploads receipt**: File uploaded to S3, URL received
5. **User enters amount**: Validates as positive integer
6. **User clicks "Continue"**:
   - Frontend generates unique session ID (if not exists)
   - Stores in localStorage: `pendingTransactionSessionId`
   - Calls `POST /api/v1/transactions/pending`
   - Backend validates brand, creates pending transaction
   - Expires in 24 hours
7. **User navigates to**: `/upload/phone` for verification
8. **User enters phone number**: OTP sent
9. **User enters OTP**: Verification happens
10. **On successful auth**:
    - `PhoneVerification` component automatically calls `/api/v1/transactions/pending/claim`
    - Backend:
      - Finds pending transaction by session ID
      - Marks as claimed
      - Creates actual `CoinTransaction` for the user
      - Updates user's balance
    - Frontend removes session ID from localStorage
    - Shows success toast
11. **User redirected to**: `/upload/success`
12. **Transaction visible in**: User's dashboard with updated balance

## 🛡️ Security & Best Practices

✅ **No PII in Pending Transactions**: Only transaction data, no user info
✅ **Server-Side Validation**: Brand existence checked before storage
✅ **Time-Limited**: Auto-expires after 24 hours
✅ **Automatic Cleanup**: Script removes expired entries
✅ **UUID Validation**: Only valid brand IDs accepted
✅ **CORS Configured**: Proper origin validation
✅ **Database Transactions**: Atomic claim operations
✅ **Indexed Queries**: Fast lookups by session_id

---

## 🧹 Maintenance

### Cleanup Script

**Location**: `apps/api/src/scripts/cleanup-pending-transactions.ts`

**Usage**:
```bash
cd apps/api
npx ts-node -r tsconfig-paths/register src/scripts/cleanup-pending-transactions.ts
```

**What it does**:
- Deletes pending transactions older than 24 hours
- Deletes claimed pending transactions older than 7 days

**Recommended Schedule** (crontab):
```bash
# Run daily at 2 AM
0 2 * * * cd /path/to/apps/api && npx ts-node -r tsconfig-paths/register src/scripts/cleanup-pending-transactions.ts
```

## 📈 Metrics to Track

### Backend
- Number of pending transactions created per day
- Claim rate (pending → actual transactions)
- Average time between creation and claim
- Expired transaction count
- Failed claim attempts

### Frontend
- Upload page visits (unauthenticated)
- Conversion rate (upload → authentication)
- Abandonment rate at each step
- Brand selection patterns
- Receipt upload success rate

2. **QR Code Sharing**: Share session ID via QR code for cross-device
3. **Admin Dashboard**: View pending transactions statistics
4. **Multiple Receipts**: Allow uploading multiple receipts per transaction
5. **Receipt OCR**: Auto-extract amount from receipt image
6. **Brand Autocomplete**: Smarter brand search in dropdown
7. **Transaction History**: Show pending transactions to authenticated users

### Phase 3 (Advanced)
1. **WhatsApp Integration**: Send OTP and reminders via WhatsApp
2. **Social Login**: Google/Facebook login support
3. **Referral System**: Share upload link with referral tracking
4. **Partial Claims**: Split one pending transaction across multiple users
5. **Export Data**: CSV export of pending transactions for analytics
